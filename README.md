# Logistic-Regression
Logistic Regression with Diabetes Readmissions dataset.

Steps for doing Logistic Regression:
1. Build various Classification Tree models by varying the number of nodes in the tree, for the Training data set for predicting the “Readmitted” variable, using the other variables.
2. Generate the confusion matrix of predictions in train and test data (actual readmitted variable versus the predicted readmitted variable labels).
3. Choose the winning tree model as the model with (a) the highest train accuracy AND the lowest fall in accuracy from train to test. In short – best performance in train and equally good performance in test.
